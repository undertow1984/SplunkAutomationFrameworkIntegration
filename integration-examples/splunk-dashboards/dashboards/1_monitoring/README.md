<h1>Examples of Integration</h1>

Examples of a wrapper, required properties, test case, and listener integration can be found in the integration-code folder. These are incomplete code examples, will contain possible syntax errors, missing imports, etc.

The intention of these code examples is to simply show some integration possibilities. It is on you as the maintainer of your automation framework to properly integrate the Splunk Connector Library provided into your code.

<h2>Integration Points within <integration-examples> </h2>

<h3>"splunk-dashboard"</h1>
The Splunk Dashboard directory contains both the XML markup to integrate directly into Splunks dashboard interface as well as screenshot examples of each dashboard.  Note the Dashboards themselves are currently a work in progress and may contain bugs.  If unsure how to utilize please work with your Splunk administrator for implementation.

<h3>Monitoring</h3>
The main entry point to the dashboard which shows the overall health of the test cases over the time period which also will apply the filters selected
