<h1>Main Project / Splunk API Library</h1>
The buildable and consumable portion of this project can be found under the project folder.  

This is a maven Java 1.8 project built utilizing the maven repository versions of GSON (https://github.com/google/gson - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson) and Jackson FasterXML (https://github.com/FasterXML - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core)

<h1>Examples of Integration</h1>

Examples of a wrapper, required properties, test case, and listener integration can be found in the integration-code folder. These are incomplete code examples, will contain possible syntax errors, missing imports, etc.

The intention of these code examples is to simply show some integration possibilities. It is on you as the maintainer of your automation framework to properly integrate the library provided into your code.

<h1>Splunk-Dashboard</h1>
The Splunk Dashboard directory contains both the XML markup to integrate directly into Splunks dashboard interface as well as screenshot examples of each dashboard.  Note the Dashboards themselves are currently a work in progress and may contain bugs.
